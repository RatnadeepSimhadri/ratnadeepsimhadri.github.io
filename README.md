Day one Monday 1:06 AM :  Me trying to get back to my blogging.
Dont this is  starting off well , Firstly its super absurd time of the day to get back to old habbits. Secondly, I am looking to try GitHub.IO and I cannot figure out a well crafter UI Templates for my personal Blog 

So Step 1: I am goin to Keep it simple  and just write some random junk to this  MD file
** PS: May be I can get back to the looks later **

Or wait a miute! May be  its not a bad idea to just try writing markup `** some **` are my first one of sorts
